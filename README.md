#Automatic Variational Inference

TensorFlow implementation of "Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference" (ADVI) [1]. This was done as part of "Advanced
Topics in Machine Learning" course at Oxford by Julian Roth, Mizu Nishikawa-Toomey and Julius Hense. 

A report summarizing our work can be found in Group_Report.pdf.

# Requirements
- Python >= 3.7.0
- TensorFlow >= 2.1.0
- TensorFlow Probability >= 0.9.0
